# JavaScript Multiple Choice Quiz

## About The Project

This is the webpage for my JavaScript quiz. It has a very simple layout when you open the webpage with a title and a button that will start the game. When you start, the timer shows on the top and counts down from 50. You are then given a question with 4 choices of possible answers. Clicking the correct answer will add on to your points and send you to the next question. Pick the wrong answer and your time will be deducted by 10 seconds. At the end of the quiz you will be able to input your name.

In the JavaScript, I made variables that corresponded to the elements in the document. When the game starts, the title and the start button and hidden and the JavaScript appends the question and answer choices into the document. After the quiz is over, the question and answer choices are hidden and a form with a place for the user to type in their name will appear.
